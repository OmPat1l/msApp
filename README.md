# msApp
This is my first hand on App Dev, trying to just learn about basic methods of intent, activity cycles, methods etc
As of now this is raw app, but i will be trying to integrate it with my self made API, "https://github.com/OmPat1l/MS-API/tree/main"
this would help me to implement the concepts of promises(asyn await) and help me refactor my api into a better one

The app conists of login page with user name lorem and password 123, home page has a event grid which on click directs to another page
for more info, the get passes page will be integrated to my api, which would use a 3rd party api like Twilio to send mails and verify identify user
